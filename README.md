## Main Question
Which routes between German cities are the fastest by car (in comparison to travel by train) and should be electrified for a "quick win" (compared to new train tracks) in climate action?

## Summary
This project makes the recommendation of electrifying the routes Rostock/Villingen-Schwenningen and Rostock/Konstanz. 

This is based on the attractiveness of train connections on the route and the degree of electrification of the connecting highways.
Both routes show significantly longer travel times by train than by car, making the time-sensitive traveller more inclined to choose the car over taking a train. Additionally, the routes show a below-average degree of electrification, suggesting high potential of improvement when adding new charging stations.

The project recommends adding charging stations to the route, which is less costly and time-consuming than modernising the connecting railways.
